Linux Kernel Development - too fast to be stable

The Linux kernel is the largest collaborative software development projects
ever.  This talk will discuss exactly how Linux is developed, how fast it is
happening, who is doing the work, and how we all stay sane keeping up with it.
It will discuss the development model used, and how it differs from almost all
"traditional" models of software development.  The talk will also go into ways
to get involved in the project, and why it is a good thing for students to
contribute to the kernel development process.


Greg Kroah-Hartman is a Fellow at the Linux Foundation.  He is currently
responsible for the stable Linux kernel releases, and is a maintainer of the
USB, TTY, and driver core subsystems in the kernel as well as other portions of
the codebase that he wishes he could forget about.  He is the author of two
books about Linux kernel development, both free online, and has written many
papers and articles about the Linux kernel.
